How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	The lines of code to view are reduced
	
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	I will be able to see where I introduced a bug and reduct to a functioning version
	
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	When you manually choose when to create a commit, the saved version is the one you 
	are comfortable to save. Automatic saving may give you many different versions whose
	differences you may not exactly know
	
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	The files in git are usually dependent on each other while those on Google Docs
	are usually mutually exclusive
	
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	Git log can be used to check the different commits in the file history while 
	git diff can be used to check the difference between files that may have or 
	have not been committed.
	
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

	You become more confident because you know that in the event you make a change
	that breaks the code, you have a previous version to fall back to
	
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	Version control
