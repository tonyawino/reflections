When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you are partnering with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Making changes automatically might save  files that are not yet ready to work 
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
  Forks are making a copy of repository and only happen online, on GitHub, while 
  clones are making copies of repository from remote location, online, to working
  station, or between working stations. Branching is making areas for parallel working.
  Forks can be used to have someone's work for modification when they do not want mods.
  Clones can be used to have someone's work on your local machine. Branches can be used 
  to modify code when not sure, or want parallel working
  
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  To know the difference between the local copies and the last commit in the remote
  
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what 
would be harder?
  Probably use email. The process would be simpler, but since you'll have to downaload 
  many files storage management wouldn't be good.
  
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?
  When you are not sure whether the changes you are making will break the code. This approach
  will ensure you have a working version
